My Design Pattern Learning
==========================

## OO Principles

- ***Encapsulate what changes.***
- ***Favor composition over inheritence.***
- ***Program to interfaces, not implementations.***
- ***Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.***
- ***Class should be open for extension, but close for modification.***

### Creational Patterns

### Strutural Patterns

- [Decorator](src/org/wenhanglei/decorator)

    > attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.Decorator provide flexible alternative to subclassing for extending funtionality.

### Behaviorl Patterns

- [Strategy](src/org/wenhanglei/strategy)

    > define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- [Observer](src/org/wenhanglei/observer)

    > defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
